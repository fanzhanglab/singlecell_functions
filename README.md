# singlecell_functions

This is a team work from the Zhang lab:
- Create generalized functions to be used to analyze different single-cell datasets.
- Implement Machine learning and statistical modeling code for single-cell omics data analysis and integration.
- Share tutorial code for single-cell QC, visualization, etc

Here we just illustrate several:
  + [Single-cell doublet detection](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/singlecell_functions/blob/main/ScrubletDetection.ipynb)
  + [Single-cell TCR analysis, take CD8 T cell TCR as an example](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/singlecell_functions/blob/main/analyze_cd8_TCR.ipynb)
  + [Tutorial of single-cell RNA-seq analytical pipeline](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/singlecell_functions/blob/main/tutorial_scRNA_analysis.ipynb)
  + [CITES-seq QC and downstream analysis](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/singlecell_functions/blob/main/citeseq_qc_backup.ipynb)
  + [Mixed effect modeling on associating single-cell data with synovial phenotypes](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/singlecell_functions/blob/main/linear_mixed_model_clinical_CTAP.ipynb)
  
- We are adding more to this repository and stay tuned!
