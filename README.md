# singlecell_functions

This is a team work from the Zhang lab:
- Create generalized functions to be used to analyze different single-cell datasets.
- Implement Machine learning and statistical modeling code for single-cell omics data analysis and integration.
- Share tutorial code for single-cell QC, visualization, etc
- More to come!
